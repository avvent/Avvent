What is project N about?
</h2><br/><hr/><br/>
<h3>A wee bit'o background</h3>
(The N in project N stands for Nous)<br/><br/>
<p>We tend to think that intelligence is something you are born with or that it is something that you inherit from your super-genius parents. Well...no. Not quite. Think of it as a skill, something that can be improved upon. You might argue that people are born to be logical while others are born to understand people. While there might be sufficient evidence to prove this, we believe there is a crucial flaw in this "system" we use to describe and test our intelligence.<br/><br/>
Why does it even matter if the system is flawed? It prevents people to excel in any given field of interest. I'm mentioning interest because that should be the only factor that determines your future. Not your school grades telling you that you are not capable of becoming a mathematician (or your math teacher for that matter). Don't get me wrong, grades are important and it can show us a lot about someone (I'll explain what it should show momentarily) but when a system is flawed it can be misleading and discouraging.<br/><br/>
What grades should show is how industrious you are. The world's most well-known companies know this and have remarked on this fact continuously. Lesser known companies also fail to see this fact. Here is where Project N comes to play. We are here to revolutionise the way intelligence is seen. We saw the flaw and we are here to fix it.<br/><br/>
The flaw, you ask? Not knowing exactly what intelligence is. Here's what we have so far, IQ tests that are partially dependable and EQ tests that determines your wisdom (please note sarcasm is being used here).It is almost true but incomplete. I know...there are other methods of testing intelligence like the 8 intelligence model but just bear with me for a moment. There is also the g-factor but all of these other tests give unreliable results. IQ and EQ tests as well but they are most known which got us thinking after we discovered something wonderful and fun: personality tests. These tests are fun to play around with especially late at night when you are bored or when you and your friends are bored together. These tests are actually used in science today but not the ones you get online. Personality tests are, just as IQ and EQ tests, unreliable. Curiosity got the better of us and we did research. We dug into the minds (books, we do not process the superpower of reading minds...yet) and noticed a reoccurring pattern in these books. More specifically, the works of Carl Jung. Most personality theories are based on his work. When I read his book on personality types I noticed something interesting. There was a link between his description of certain types of people and IQ and EQ tests. Then followed tons of question that lead to our discovery.<br/><br/>
IQ and EQ are only half of the spectrum and personality tests are the guide. Not only that but it can also be improved. Then why is there so little evidence to prove this and why haven't we yet improved it? Simple, we are given a flawed way of thinking about intelligence.

<h3>The brain and its function</h3>
(This is an over simplified version of how it actually works)<br/><br/>
<p>Think input/output. Our brain receives information, processes it and then stores the information. The information is then retrieved, processed and then used to make a decision. The process part is important. It determines the quality of our mind. If the information stored is of bad quality then the decisions you make will also be of bad quality no matter how good you are at making decisions. It also determines how well we understand the information. So...the brain can be said to have an input (perception) and output (judgement).<br/><br/>
When we perceive we use two, as we call it, functions but in conjunction. These functions are our intuition and our sensation but as humans work they tend to favour one over the other. It can be to such a degree that the one function is completely ignored. When this happens it can mean that that person struggles to take in information that requires that function and can cause him/her to seem like they are incapable. IQ tests test only one of these functions: intuition. They are missing the other parts of the equation: sensation. <br/><br/>
Now when we judge we retrieve the information stored by our perception and use, again, two function; thinking and feeling. EQ tests test our Feeling and are, again, missing the other part of the equation: thinking. All these functions can be improved. The only factor that determines if it will improve is how industrious that person is.

<h3>Project N</h3>
(What we are planning...)<br/><br/>
<p>
We have created a system that can be implemented into schools and businesses to take the first step in the right direction. We have created an app that students can use to take our test (they can take the test as many times as they want, we encourage it) and the teacher can use it to see how their students think. The teachers can then use this information to devise a new teaching method that fits every student or help struggling students get their A. Students can also use it to see where they need to improve on and learn how the can do so through our app. We will be releasing this new system in 2018 and will be going from school to school to implement it (only available through us). Businesses can also use it to increase their staffs' productivity and consumers' happiness on their services.
